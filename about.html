        <p> Bonjour !</p>
        <p>To make it short before my travel timeline, I am an Island, Sun, Ocean lover. I dive and freedive, dream of becoming a surfer one day. 
            <br>I am a foodie, always looking for the best places to have a food experience. </p>
        <p>Planet lover, so I try to make the most concious choices</p>

        <p> I am 32 years old et I am touch all. I was born in 1990 in Cannes and spend my summer time up in the mountain. <br>
            At the age of 19 I left to visit Brazil and Israel. My two first major travel, that changed me and made me a travel addict.

        <p>In 2012, after saving money for two years working in restaurants, I left for Australia by my self. I spend a full year there and became a barista while studying Interior Design. 
            <br> It was my richest travel experience, living abroad for the first time, learning a new language, meeting new cultures.</p>
