The city offers beautiful architecture, great food scene and a unique vibe in the Summer.

#### TRANSPORT

Copenhagen is one of the easiest city to access.

<u>From the airport</u>, you follow the sign for the metro. Buy a ticket either just to your destination of a city pass ( see below). The metro takes you in the heart of Copenhagen.

<u>To go around:</u> there are two metro lines in the city that goes pretty much all around the center. Otherwise you have the trains & ferry bus.

And of course by <u>bikes</u>, the most use transport in Cph. You can rent one at your hotel or in a lot of shops except on Sunday where most of businesses are closed.

### What to see?

I think 3 days it's the minimum time you need to visit the city. Walk around in the center, get lost in smalls streets it's full of hidden gems. Enjoy the colorful buildings.

Copenhagen has become a huge food city, so I will make a full article for food itself. But here get few nice places around the city.

All the places below offer vegetarian menu. Check it out for Vegan & GF if needed.

<u>Mad &amp; Kaffe: </u>Perfect for Breakfast & Brunch (until 11h30) no bookings and few places in the city.

<u>&Oslash;12:</u> Brunch / Lunch all day long.

<u>Union Kitchen:</u> Brunch /Lunch, right behind Nyhavn

<u>Coffee Collective: </u>If you need a nice coffee break during the day.

<u>Original Coffee:</u> Same as good and a lot of places around.

<u>LLama</u>\: Dinner place, High quality, South American fusion cuisine, Lounge later at night. My fav restaurant for a treat.

<u>Keyser Social:</u> Asian Fusion Cuisine, if you like Asian food this will be goood.

Ammas: If you want to try the Danish Specialty, I heard it's one of the best for it. sm&oslash;rbr&oslash;d ( open sandwich). It's not for me but some loves it and well it's part of visiting a country right ?
