Belajar is nested in the heart of Canggu. We stayed here our two last night on the Island to relax and enjoy. Boutique hotel with 8 suites, a communal kitchen, dinning area and stunning pool.&nbsp;

Belajar is located only five minutes drive away from all my favorite cafés and&nbsp; beaches.&nbsp;

Loved waking up early morning, go make my coffee in the kitchen and enjoy it in the living room while looking at the pool.&nbsp;

Perfect place to either arrive or leave Bali.&nbsp;

[Check availability here](https://belajarbali.com/#/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.&nbsp;

#### SUITE

Large beautiful room, they thought of all details, usb charger / plugs next to the bed, storage for your clothing, light blocking curtains …&nbsp;

The bathroom look like an open one but it's closed. Stunning is all I have to say.&nbsp;

#### SHARED AREA

Beautiful living room with A/C, perfect to work or just chill. Love the top part if you want to relax and read a book. Or just take pics haha.&nbsp;

#### POOL&nbsp;

I literally spend hours in this spot getting the sun while soaking my feet in the water.&nbsp;
