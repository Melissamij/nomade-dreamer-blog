Did you know it was built based on Amsterdam and to become a main harbor in the area.

Called K&oslash;benhavn in Danish which mean "k&oslash;b = to buy" "havn= harbor".

The city offers beautiful architecture, great food scene and a unique vibe in the Summer.

**Best season:** For sure Summer, it will allow you to enjoy the most of the city. But in Denmark you can never be sure of the weather.

#### TRANSPORT
{: .center}

Copenhagen is one of the easiest city to access.

***From the airport***, you follow the sign for the metro. Buy a ticket either just to your destination of a city pass ( see below). The metro takes you in the heart of Copenhagen.

***To go around:*** there are two metro lines in the city that goes pretty much all around the center. Otherwise you have the trains & ferry bus.

And of course by ***bikes,*** the most use transport in Cph. You can rent one at your hotel or in a lot of shops except on Sunday where most of businesses are closed.

***Transport:***<u> </u>Download the app "[<u>DOT</u>](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/tourist/tickets/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}"&nbsp; and chose what's best for you.

### What to see?
{: .center}

I think 3 days it's the minimum time you need to visit the city. Walk around in the center, get lost in smalls streets it's full of hidden gems. Enjoy the colorful buildings.

You can follow me on [Mapster](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and access my map of Copenhagen with all those address saved and more.

***The most popular spots:***

Nyhavn ( the colored houses), use to be the main harbor.

Little Mermaid ( she is really little ) go walk around the Kastellet next to it.

Christiana (the free city).

Amelienborg (The Royal Palace).

Tivoli ( oldest attraction park still in use) fee to enter and fee to do attractions.

***Places to see on a sunny day:***

Assistens Kirkeg&aring;rd ( cemetery) Sounds weird I know, but I never seen cemetry like that before. In France they are all grey and concrete, here it's more like small park where life & death cohabit.&nbsp;

F&aelig;lledparken ( huge park in the city cool for a walk in nature)

Lacs ( in the middle of the city)

Rundetaarn ( view of the city)

Street Food Reffen (Open in Summer only)
