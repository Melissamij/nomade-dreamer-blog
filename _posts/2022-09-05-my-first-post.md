#### TRANSPORT

Copenhagen is one of the easiest city to access.

<u>From the airport</u>, you follow the sign for the metro. Buy a ticket either just to your destination of a city pass ( see below).The metro takes you in the heart of Copenhagen.

<u>To go around:</u> there are two metro lines in the city that goes pretty much all around the center. Otherwise you have the trains & ferry bus.

And of course by <u>bikes</u>, the most use transport in Cph. You can rent one at your hotel or in a lot of shops except on Sunday where most of businesses are closed.

### What to see?

I think 3 days it's the minimum time you need to visit the city. Walk around in the center, get lost in smalls streets it's full of hidden gems. Enjoy the colorful buildings.

<u>The most popular spots:</u>

* Nyhavn ( the colored houses), use to be the main harbor.
* Little Mermaid ( she is really little ) go walk around the Kastellet next to it.

* Tivoli ( oldest attraction park still in use) fee to enter and fee to do attractions.

<u>Places to see on a sunny day:</u>

* Lacs ( in the middle of the city)
* Rundetaarn ( view of the city)

#### Going out:

* K&oslash;dbyen ( Old Meat packing district now restaurants and bars to party)
* PS Bar
* Generator

#### Where to eat ?

Copenhagen has become a huge food city, so I will make a full article for food itself. But here get few nice places around the city.

All the places below offer vegetarian menu. Check it out for Vegan & GF if needed.

<u>Mad &amp; Kaffe: </u>Perfect for Breakfast & Brunch (until 11h30) no bookings and few places in the city.

<u>&Oslash;12:</u> Brunch / Lunch all day long.

<u>Union Kitchen:</u> Brunch /Lunch, right behind Nyhavn

<u>Coffee Collective: </u>If you need a nice coffee break during the day.

<u>Original Coffee:</u> Same as good and a lot of places around.

<u>LLama</u>\: Dinner place, High quality, South American fusion cuisine, Lounge later at night. My fav restaurant for a treat.

<u>Keyser Social:</u> Asian Fusion Cuisine, if you like Asian food this will be goood.

<u>Ammas:</u> If you want to try the Danish Specialty, I heard it's one of the best for it. sm&oslash;rbr&oslash;d ( open sandwich). It's not for me but some loves it and well it's part of visiting a country right ?
