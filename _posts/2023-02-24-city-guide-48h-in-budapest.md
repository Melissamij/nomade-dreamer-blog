**INFORMATION**

***About:&nbsp;***Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.

***Formality:***&nbsp; Budapest is part of Europe, so for Europeans you need a valid ID of 6months before return. For non EU resident check depending of your country.

**Currency:** Hungarian forint (HUF)

***Time:***&nbsp; Central European Standard Time

**Best season:** I would not go in summer as I imagined it gets hot. I think spring and fall are perfect.&nbsp;

**TRANSPORT**

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and paid around 200kr / 19€.

You can also take a bus to the city center for 4€, line No. 100E.

***To go around:&nbsp;**&nbsp;*You have the choice between metro/tram/bus. But honestly we walked a lot and when we needed we just took a taxi. We paid around 50kr ( 6€) per way, which make more sense when you are 3.

You can also get a [**Budapest Card**](https://m.budapestinfo.hu/webshop) with Free public transport, discounts, museum access etc..

**WHAT TO SEE?**

Budapest is such a beautiful city, two days was a bit short I must admit. But we managed to walk a lot in the city center.

Check my [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb) map, I saved all my addresses there.

**Parlamento**

**St. Stephen's Basilica**

![](/budapest/IMG_7373.JPG){: width="3024" height="4032"}

**Liberty Bridge / Gellért Hill**

![](/budapest/IMG_7407.JPG){: .-image width="3024" height="4032"}![](/budapest/IMG_7385.JPG){: .-image width="3024" height="4032"}

Gellért Hill, is a 15min walk up, lots of stairs but best view of the city and the bridge. Go at sunset time for great pictures.&nbsp;

It's also right next to the Spa.&nbsp;

**THERMAL BATH:**

They are so many options to chose from. For this first trip we chose the two most known.&nbsp;

**Gellért Spa**

**![](/budapest/IMG_7170.JPG){: width="3024" height="4032"}**

![](/budapest/IMG_7177.JPG){: .-image width="3024" height="4032"}![](/budapest/IMG_7174.JPG){: .-image width="3010" height="4013"}

***Entrance:&nbsp; ***Around 200dkk/pers ( 25€), [book here](https://tickets.gellertbath.hu/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It has been ma favorite one. It's really nice to take the cabine if you come straight from the airport so you can leave all your laguages in.&nbsp;

**Széchenyi Thermal Bath&nbsp;**

**Going out:**

**Where to eat ?**

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on insta if you have any questions. And have a great trip!

#### TRANSPORT
{: .center}

Copenhagen is one of the easiest city to access.

***From the airport***, you follow the sign for the metro. Buy a ticket either just to your destination of a city pass ( see below). The metro takes you in the heart of Copenhagen.

***To go around:*** there are two metro lines in the city that goes pretty much all around the center. Otherwise you have the trains & ferry bus.

And of course by ***bikes,*** the most use transport in Cph. You can rent one at your hotel or in a lot of shops except on Sunday where most of businesses are closed.

### What to see?
{: .center}

I think 3 days it's the minimum time you need to visit the city. Walk around in the center, get lost in smalls streets it's full of hidden gems. Enjoy the colorful buildings.

You can follow me on [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and access my map of Copenhagen with all those address saved and more.

***The most popular spots:***

Nyhavn ( the colored houses), use to be the main harbor.

Little Mermaid ( she is really little ) go walk around the Kastellet next to it.

Christiana (the free city).

Amelienborg (The Royal Palace).
