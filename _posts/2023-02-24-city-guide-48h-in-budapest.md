**INFORMATION**

***About:&nbsp;***Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.

***Formality:***&nbsp; Budapest is part of Europe, so for Europeans you need a valid ID of 6months before return. For non EU resident check depending of your country.

**Currency:** Hungarian forint (HUF)

***Time:***&nbsp; Central European Standard Time

**Best season:** I would not go in summer as I imagined it gets hot. I think spring and fall are perfect.&nbsp;

**TRANSPORT**

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and paid around 200kr / 19€.

You can also take a bus to the city center for 4€, line No. 100E.

***To go around:&nbsp;**&nbsp;*You have the choice between metro/tram/bus. But honestly we walked a lot and when we needed we just took a taxi. We paid around 50kr ( 6€) per way, which make more sense when you are 3.

You can also get a [**Budapest Card**](https://m.budapestinfo.hu/webshop) with Free public transport, discounts, museum access etc..

**WHAT TO SEE?**

Budapest is such a beautiful city, two days was a bit short I must admit. But we managed to walk a lot in the city center.

Check my [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb) map, I saved all my addresses there.

**Parlamento**

**St. Stephen's Basilica**

**Liberty Bridge / Gellért Hill**

Gellért Hill, is a 15min walk up, lots of stairs but best view of the city and the bridge. Go at sunset time for great pictures.&nbsp;

It's also right next to the Spa.&nbsp;

**THERMAL BATH:**

They are so many options to chose from. For this first trip we chose the two most known.&nbsp;

**Gellért Spa**

*\*\*Entrance:&nbsp; \*\**Around 200dkk/pers ( 25€), [book here](https://tickets.gellertbath.hu/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It has been ma favorite one. It's really nice to take the cabine if you come straight from the airport so you can leave all your laguages in.&nbsp;

**Széchenyi Thermal Bath&nbsp;**

**Going out:**

**Where to eat ?**

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on insta if you have any questions. And have a great trip!
