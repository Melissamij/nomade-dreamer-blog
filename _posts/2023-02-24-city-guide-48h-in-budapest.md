**INFORMATION**

***About:&nbsp;***Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.

***Formality:***&nbsp; Budapest is part of Europe, so for Europeans you need a valid ID of 6months before return. For non EU resident check depending of your country.

**Currency:** Hungarian forint (HUF)

***Time:***&nbsp; Central European Standard Time

**Best season:** I would not go in summer as I imagined it gets hot. I think spring and fall are perfect.&nbsp;

**TRANSPORT**

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and paid around 200kr / 19€.

You can also take a bus to the city center for 4€, line No. 100E.

***To go around:&nbsp;**&nbsp;*You have the choice between metro/tram/bus. But honestly we walked a lot and when we needed we just took a taxi. We paid around 50kr ( 6€) per way, which make more sense when you are 3.

You can also get a [**Budapest Card**](https://m.budapestinfo.hu/webshop) with Free public transport, discounts, museum access etc..

**WHAT TO SEE?**

Budapest is such a beautiful city, two days was a bit short I must admit. But we managed to walk a lot in the city center.

Check my [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb) map, I saved all my addresses there.

**Parlamento**

**St. Stephen's Basilica**

**Liberty Bridge / Gellért Hill**

Gellért Hill, is a 15min walk up, lots of stairs but best view of the city and the bridge. Go at sunset time for great pictures.&nbsp;

It's also right next to the Spa.&nbsp;

**THERMAL BATH:**

They are so many options to chose from. For this first trip we chose the two most known.&nbsp;

**Gellért Spa**

**![](/budapest/IMG_7170.JPG){: width="3024" height="4032"}**

*\*\*Entrance:&nbsp; \*\**Around 200dkk/pers ( 25€), [book here](https://tickets.gellertbath.hu/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It has been ma favorite one. It's really nice to take the cabine if you come straight from the airport so you can leave all your laguages in.&nbsp;

**Széchenyi Thermal Bath&nbsp;**

I did not took pictures as we went at night and it was really busy. But I did not like it so much, it's only pools all around and not really clean to be honest.&nbsp;

**AIRBNB&nbsp;**

The girls found the most amazing appartement ever. A bit expensive but if you ask me all worth it.&nbsp;[Link&nbsp;](https://fr.airbnb.com/rooms/628940181902144408?adults=1&amp;checkin=&amp;checkout=&amp;children=0&amp;infants=0&amp;pets=0&amp;wishlist_item_id=11001777467668&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1677245141_tHOo3PXmUi4N8mls){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

3 bedrooms ( 1 master with bathtube) .

**LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD & DRINKS**

**![](/budapest/IMG_7446.JPG){: .-image width="3024" height="4032"}![](/budapest/IMG_0905.JPG){: .-image width="3024" height="4032"}**

Here are places we tried and liked.&nbsp;

If you go during the week-end, book in advance as all the places where full.&nbsp;

Dinner at Kollázs, restaurant of the four season hôtel, French bistrot. €€

Dinner at Twentysix, méditeranéen food. This place is amazing, indoor jungle, great food to share and drinks. €€

Cookie Beacon, if you are in for a treat during the long walks. €

Lion's locker for a good brunch ( you can also leave your bags there for the day by the way.€

Karavan street food, great to try some traditional food and more. In the party street ;). €

Szimpla Kert for drinks, it's a ruin bar. Famous bars in Budapest, we really liked the vibe of this one. This street is where you have all the bars and clubs!

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on insta if you have any questions. And have a great trip!
