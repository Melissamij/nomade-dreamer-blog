( Note: related post will be added about each areas with hotels, restaurants and what to see … )&nbsp;

Let's start with an overall idea of the **different areas**.

* Canggu&nbsp;
* Uluwatu ( The bukit South)
* Ubud ( Center)&nbsp;
* Sidemen ( East)
* North Bali&nbsp;

Then the other islands around that you should add to your list.&nbsp;

* Nusa Lembogan, Ceningan
* Nusa Penida
* Lombok
* The Gili Islands
* Flores / Komodo&nbsp;

**CANGGU&nbsp;**

Canggu has became the must place to go to. When I went to Bali 12 years ago for the first time, I did not even heard about it.&nbsp;

But today you cannot miss it. Canggu has it all !

Perfect beaches to learn to surf & chill, yoga, the best cafés on the island, beach club, coolest boutique and amazing hotels / villas.&nbsp;

It's my favorite area of Bali but it's not everyone cup of tea as it's quiet busy.&nbsp;

**ULUWATU ( THE BUKIT)**

If you are looking for a place to relax, blue water … Uluwatu is for you.&nbsp;

I missed it the two times I came to Bali and I can tell you, don't do the same mistake.&nbsp;

Such a cute area, the roads are beautiful, the beach with lagoon area stunning, if you surf you will find some of the best spots here.&nbsp;

The sunsets are epic and there is some really cool places to go party as well.&nbsp;

Enjoy the steep stairs, narrow street to find the most pretty beaches.&nbsp;

**UBUD&nbsp;**

Probably the most known place of Bali.&nbsp;

Away from the coast, Ubud is known for the yoga retreats, temples & rice fields.&nbsp;

It's a busy town as well, but you can easily find quiet areas.&nbsp;

I would recommend to go for few nights to explore the area.&nbsp;

**SIDEMEN**

Are you looking for rice field, no one on the roads, bambou houses & flower bath ?&nbsp;

Well then this is for you 100% !

I drove around Sidemen and I absolutely loved it. You will feel away from it all.&nbsp;

**NORHT BALI ( BATUR)**

Ready to travel off the beaten path ? Head up to the north part of Bali.&nbsp;

Go hike the volcano Mount Batur, check all the waterfalls, go swim with Dolphins in Lovina, see baby turtle getting released …&nbsp;

It's an area I will go visit a bit more next time for sure.&nbsp;

**AROUND BALI**

Are you looking for peace ? Island without trafic ? Blue waters ?&nbsp;

Then you should check the Gili's, Ceningan & Lembongan .

**LOMBOK**

Bali's sister, pretty much the same size but way more wild. I could not go this time but I did 4 years ago and loved it.&nbsp;

Lombok is Bali 20 years ago, more and more cafés and restaurants are opening in the south part.&nbsp;

**FLORES / KOMODO**

1 hour away by plane from Bali, you'll find one of the best diving spot in the world and desert beaches.&nbsp;

Been to Komodo twice now, and I can only advice you to go ! Next time I will have to explore Flores island, but each time I went was to dive mostly.&nbsp;
