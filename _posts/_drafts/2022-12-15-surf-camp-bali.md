#### INFORMATION

*If you dream to learn to surf but don't know where to start you are in the right place.&nbsp;*

*When I planned my solo trip to Bali, my goal was to learn surfing and meet people. What's best than a surf camp ? But then which one to chose ?&nbsp;*

I booked at Wave House and let me explain how good it was.&nbsp;





#### TRANSPORT

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and

##### Gellért Hill / Bath

Go there at sunset to have the light over the city. Lots of stairs but worth it. Takes around 15min to go up.

There is two ways to go up, from Géllert Bath or from the next bridge ( the new one).

At the top you will see the **Liberty Statue.** It was on renovation when we went but I imagine the view must be amazing when open.

You can do it either when you go the the Gellért Bath or another time, it's right next to it.

#### Going out:

Budapest is known to go out. Unfortunately it was a busy week-end and long days so we did not go out.

We tried a Ruin Bar in the center, which was really nice. In that area you will find lots of bars and clubs.

* Szimpla Kert



#### Where to eat ?

Olalala the food places in Budapest ! I was really surprised by the amount of brunch places you can find.

I recommend you to check the instagram page of @[budapestfoodguide](https://www.instagram.com/budapestfoodguide/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for inspiration.

But here is a list of places we tried and can recommend.

###### Brunch:

* Lion's Locker
* Cookie Beacon

###### Dinner:

Remember to book if you go on week-ends, Saturday everything was fully booked. I book for Sunday and luckily, when we arrived there was a huge line.

* Karavan (street food)
* Kollázs ( French Bistro)
* TwentySix ( Mediterranean Food)
* Mazel Tov (Mediterranean Food)

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on instagram if you have any questions. And have a great trip!
