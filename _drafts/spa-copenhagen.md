***About: ***Denmark is quiet different from the other country in Scandinavia. We don't have all those sauna for free around. So you have to find your way around to get cool spot to relax and warm up in the winter.

I will share with you the spot I tried or recommended places.

***Sauna Gus:&nbsp; ***I never heard of it before trying it out here. It's an aroma therapy in the sauna. Must try \!

***Location: ***Refshalevej 141, 1432 K&oslash;benhavn

***Info:*** One of my favorite place in the city no matter what season.

This is not a spa place, it's a café / restaurant in front of the water where we go swimming all year long.

But they have the cutest little sauna with a view on the water.

***Price:*** 1H45 minutes for 400kr. You book the entire sauna for yourself, up to 8people.

### Marienlyst Spa

![](/Spa/marienlyst-strandspa.webp){: width="600" height="607"}

***Location:*** Nordre Strandvej 2A, 3000 Helsing&oslash;r

It's not in Copenhagen, it's 1h drive up north. You get also get there by train.

***Info:*** It takes its name after Marienlyst House , a neighboring former royal summer retreat, which was part of it from its foundation in 1859 until 1896. Facilities include a restaurant, bar, wellness area and a casino. The Danish national football team stays at the hotel in connection with home matches and training sessions.

It's a full spa, with 3 different sauna's, bubble bath, steam room, pool and more.

I would say I did not have the best experience going there. They did not give us any information about the place, it took us a while to realize there was two sauna downstairs connecting to the beach / sea. We did not knew about the sauna gus time... so I have mix feeling.

But the view is amazing, if you go make sure to do the sauna gus\* before the night comes so you can enjoy the Ocean view.

***Price:&nbsp; ***They have a lot of different options but it start from 300kr for a spa day. Here is a [link](https://booking.marienlyst.dk/da/standalone-extras){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for you.
