***About: ***Denmark is quiet different from the other country in Scandinavia. We don't have all those sauna for free around. So you have to find your way around to get cool spot to relax and warm up in the winter.

I will share with you the spot I tried or recommended places.

***Sauna Gus:&nbsp; ***I never heard of it before trying it out here. It's an aroma therapy in the sauna. Must try \!

### CopenHot

***Location:&nbsp; ***Bernhard Bangs Alle 41, 2000 Frederiksberg

To get there you can take a bus from the city and just walk few hundred meters or the train / metro to Flintholm Station and walk for around 15min.

***Option:&nbsp; ***This place is part of a public swimming pool so nothing fancy. But really good price for what you get.

There is a steambath ( hamman), sauna with a Sauna Gus\*, hot-tub..And you can also access to swimming pool if you want to workout a little.

***Price:***

185dkk/pers for 1H50 from your booking arrival time.

### La Banchina

***Location: ***Refshalevej 141, 1432 K&oslash;benhavn

***Option:*** One of my favorite place in the city no matter what season.

This is not a spa place, it's a café / restaurant in front of the water where we go swimming all year long.

But they have the cutest little sauna with a view on the water.

***Price:*** 1H45 minutes for 400kr. You book the entire sauna for yourself, up to 8people.
