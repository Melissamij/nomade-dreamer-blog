***About: ***Denmark is quiet different from the other country in Scandinavia. We don't have all those sauna for free around. So you have to find your way around to get cool spot to relax and warm up in the winter.

I will share with you the spot I tried or recommended places.

***Sauna Gus:&nbsp; ***I never heard of it before trying it out here. It's an aroma therapy in the sauna. Must try \!

### CopenHot

&nbsp;

***Location:&nbsp; ***Actually relocating but Here is the link to their [website](https://copenhot.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} so you can check it out.

***Options: *** They have hot tubes, sauna and hot boat ( small boat with a fireplace to warm up the salty water from the sea).

***Prices: (*** will update as soon as they reopen)

### Flintholm Kurbad

&nbsp;

***Location:&nbsp; ***Bernhard Bangs Alle 41, 2000 Frederiksberg

To get there you can take a bus from the city and just walk few hundred meters or the train / metro to Flintholm Station and walk for around 15min.

***Option:&nbsp; ***This place is part of a public swimming pool so nothing fancy. But really good price for what you get.

There is a steambath ( hamman), sauna with a Sauna Gus\*, hot-tub..And you can also access to swimming pool if you want to workout a little.

***Prices:***

185dkk/pers.
