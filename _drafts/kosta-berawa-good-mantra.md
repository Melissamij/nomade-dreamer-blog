After a month travelling and moving from place to place, and a diving accident. I needed a place to relax and settle. I found Kosta Hostel and booked myself a private double room.&nbsp;

Kosta is a boutique hostel, colorful and vibrant.

You have the choice to book a private room, dorm rooms. All the rooms have their own bathroom and AC.&nbsp;

Kosta has a pool and a top deck with a yoga space.&nbsp;

You can also asked them to book surf classes !

The location is just perfect, in the quiet side of Berawa but few minutes walk from the beach and lots of cool cafes. Kosta has their own restaurant downstairs " Good Mantra".&nbsp;

Plant based restaurants with nice option, really good coffee and great to work if you need.&nbsp;

It's all I like, local farmers, producers, organic as much as possible, seasonal products.&nbsp;
