#### **Cultural Insights:**

Sumba is rich in culture and traditions. The island is famous for its unique funeral ceremonies, stunning handwoven fabrics (known as "ikat"), and megalithic tombs. Visitors can witness these cultural elements by participating in local ceremonies or visiting traditional villages.

**Unique Architecture:**

**Ikat Textiles:**

* Ikat textiles in Sumba are highly regarded for their intricate designs and vibrant colors. They are created using a traditional weaving technique that has been passed down through generations.

#### How To Get There ?&nbsp;

Getting to Sumba from Bali typically involves taking a flight to Sumba's Tambolaka Airport or Waingapu Airport. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get to Sumba from Bali:

**Book a Flight from Bali to Sumba:**

* Start by booking a flight from Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali to either Tambolaka Airport (TMC) or Waingapu Airport (WGP) in Sumba. Tambolaka Airport is located in West Sumba, while Waingapu Airport is in East Sumba.

**Airlines That Operate Flights:**

* Several airlines operate flights between Bali and Sumba, including Garuda Indonesia, Wings Air, and Nam Air. These airlines offer daily flights, but schedules and availability may vary, so it's advisable to check with the respective airlines for the most up-to-date information.

**Local Transportation:**

* While exploring Sumba, you can use local transportation such as bemos (shared minibuses) or rent a motorbike to get around. Bikes are in pretty bad shape and expensive.

#### **Best Season to Visit:**

Sumba Island enjoys a tropical climate, making it a year-round destination. However, the best time to visit is during the dry season, which typically spans from May to September.

During this period, you can expect sunny days, calm seas, and pleasant temperatures, making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploration.

#### **&nbsp;Accommodation:**

Sumba offers a range of accommodation options, from luxury resorts to budget guesthouses. Be sure to book your accommodation in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons.

#### Day Trip Tour:&nbsp;

On my way back to the airport, I took a day tour to visit this two main spot of the Island. Price: 1.200.000IDR

While just going to the airport is half the price so it's worth it. And I share with two girls to drop them off on the way ;).&nbsp;

While those two places are the most famous one of the Island, they are also my worst memories of the Island.&nbsp;

I do not recommend it for women travelling alone ! ( tell you more bellow if interested).

**Laguna Waikurri, Sumba Barat Daya:**

Entrance fees: 20.000. They say it's free to fly your drone but after my experience I did not feel like it.&nbsp;

The place is really beautiful, but I had few of the local boys following me in the water, looking under the water with their masks.. and I am talking teenager age or older. I was not feeling super confortable to be honest.&nbsp;

They were doing that only to women alone of course ...

**Pante Ratenggaro:**

This picturesque village is famous for its traditional tall-roofed huts and megalithic tombs. It provides a glimpse into the island's rich cultural heritage.

Entrance fee: 50.000k&nbsp;

They don't tell you when you come in that you have to pay for the drone, only after. They charged me 75.000k with no choice but to pay ! + 20.000 for that pictures with the kids ( which I ask before hand of course and they tell you after the picture ).&nbsp;
