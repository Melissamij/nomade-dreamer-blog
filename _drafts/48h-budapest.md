#### INFORMATION

***About:&nbsp;***Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.

***Formality:***&nbsp; Budapest is part of Europe, so for Europeans you need a valid ID of 6months before return. For non EU resident check depending of your country.

**Currency:** Hungarian forint (HUF)

***Time:***&nbsp; Central European Standard Time

**Best season:** I would not go in summer as I imagined it gets hot. I think spring and fall are perfect.&nbsp;

#### TRANSPORT

&nbsp;

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and paid around 200kr / 19€

You can also take a bus to the city center for 4€, line No. 100E.

*\*\*To go around: \*\**You have the choice between metro/tram/bus. But honestly we walked a lot and when we needed we just took a taxi. We paid around 50kr ( 6€) per way, which make more sense when you are 3.

You can also get a [**Budapest Card**](https://m.budapestinfo.hu/webshop){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with Free public transport, discounts, museum access etc..

&nbsp;

### What to see?

Budapest is such a beautiful city, two days was a bit short I must admit. But we managed to walk a lot in the city center.

Check my [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} map, I saved all my addresses there.

#### Going out:

K&oslash;dbyen ( Old Meat packing district now restaurants and bars to party).

PS Bar ( Dinner & Club, get dressed ).

Generator ( Hostel in the city with cool bar and petanque fields).

Boullebar ( petanque bar in the city).

Reffen Street Food (to watch the sunset, eat & enjoy drinks.)

&nbsp;

#### Where to eat ?

Copenhagen has become a huge food city, so I will make a full article for food itself. But here get few nice places around the city.

All the places below offer vegetarian menu. Check it out for Vegan & GF if needed.

&nbsp;

*Mad & Kaffe:* Perfect for Breakfast & Brunch (until 11h30) no bookings and few places in the city.

*&Oslash;12:* Brunch / Lunch all day long.

*Union Kitchen:* Brunch /Lunch, right behind Nyhavn

*Coffee Collective:* If you need a nice coffee break during the day.

*Original Coffee:* Same as good and a lot of places around.

*LLama:* Dinner place, High quality, South American fusion cuisine, Lounge later at night. My fav restaurant for a treat.

*Keyser Social:* Asian Fusion Cuisine, if you like Asian food this will be goood.

*Ammas:* If you want to try the Danish Specialty, I heard it's one of the best for it. sm&oslash;rbr&oslash;d ( open sandwich). It's not for me but some loves it and well it's part of visiting a country right ?

&nbsp;

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on insta if you have any questions. And have a great trip\!
