#### INFORMATION

***About:&nbsp;***Budapest, Hungary’s capital, is bisected by the River Danube.

***Formality:***&nbsp; Budapest is part of Europe, so for Europeans you need a valid ID of 6months before return. For non EU resident check depending of your country.

**Currency:** Hungarian forint (HUF)

***Time:***&nbsp; Central European Standard Time

**Best season:** I would not go in summer as I imagined it gets hot. I think spring and fall are perfect.&nbsp;

#### TRANSPORT

&nbsp;

***From the airport***, we took a taxi from the airport directly to the Gellert Thermal and paid around 200kr / 19€

You can also take a bus to the city center for 4€, line No. 100E.

*\*\*To go around: \*\**You have the choice between metro/tram/bus. But honestly we walked a lot and when we needed we just took a taxi. We paid around 50kr ( 6€) per way, which make more sense when you are 3.

You can also get a [**Budapest Card**](https://m.budapestinfo.hu/webshop){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} with Free public transport, discounts, museum access etc..

&nbsp;

### What to see?

Budapest is such a beautiful city, two days was a bit short I must admit. But we managed to walk a lot in the city center.

Check my [Mapstr](https://go.mapstr.com/SxSgCvaNulb){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} map, I saved all my addresses there.

##### Parlamento

##### St. Stephen's Basilica

##### Liberty Bridge

&nbsp;

##### Gellért Hill

Go there at sunset to have the light over the city. Lots of stairs but worth it. Takes around 15min to go up.

You can do it either when you go the the Gellért Bath or another time, it's right next to it.

There is two ways to go up, from Géllert Bath or from the next bridge ( the new one).

At the top you will see the **Liberty Statue.** It was on renovation when we went but I imagine the view must be amazing when open.

&nbsp;

#### Going out:

Budapest is known to go out. Unfortunately it was a busy week-end and long days so we did not go out.

We tried a Ruin Bar in the center, which was really nice. In that area you will find lots of bars and clubs.

* Szimpla Kert

&nbsp;

#### Where to eat ?

Olalala the food places in Budapest \! I was really surprised by the amount of brunch places you can find.

I recommend you to check the instagram page of @[budapestfoodguide](https://www.instagram.com/budapestfoodguide/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for inspiration.

But here is a list of places we tried and can recommend.

###### Brunch:

* Lion's Locker
* Cookie Beacon

###### Dinner:

Remember to book if you go on week-ends, Saturday everything was fully booked. I book for Sunday and luckily, when we arrived there was a huge line.

* Karavan (street food)
* Koll&aacute;zs ( French Bistro)
* TwentySix ( Mediterranean Food)
* Mazel Tov (Mediterranean Food)

I think with that you have all you need to start planing your week end, send me a DM on insta if you have any questions. And have a great trip\!
