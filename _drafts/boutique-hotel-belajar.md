![](/uploads/img-2117.webp){: width="800" height="600"}Belajar is nested in the heart of Canggu. We stayed here our two last night on the Island to relax and enjoy. Boutique hotel with 8 suites, a communal kitchen, dinning area and stunning pool.&nbsp;

Belajar is located only five minutes drive away from all my favorite cafés and&nbsp; beaches.&nbsp;

Loved waking up early morning, go make my coffee in the kitchen and enjoy it in the living room while looking at the pool.&nbsp;

Perfect place to either arrive or leave Bali.&nbsp;
