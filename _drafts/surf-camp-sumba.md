#### Dreaming to surf in Sumba ?&nbsp;

If you like to surf, Sumba is the ultimate dream vacation. Glassy, consistent, empty line ups, your dream come true.&nbsp;

Waking up every morning at 5h30am, watching the incredible sunrise from the garden. Birds singing, sounds of paradise.&nbsp;

In front of Sumba Surf Camp, lies KEREWE right. Great for beginner as well.&nbsp;

#### Packages:

When you book, it's accommodation, daily surf and food.&nbsp;

I paid 250€ for 3 nights +&nbsp; 85€ for both way to the airport.&nbsp;

If you are few people arriving or leaving you can share that cost.&nbsp;

#### The rooms:

The camp has 4 rooms and 5 bungalows with AC.&nbsp;

The bungalows are really stunning but hard to afford if you are solo. You will probably end up in the rooms, cute but not as cute ;).&nbsp;

**The Owners:**

Founder Arno ( French) and his wife & kids, have been in Sumba for over a decade. For years they builded step by step their dream place, did not have electricity until two years ago.

Dinner is&nbsp; served family style, all together around the dinning table open on the garden. Perfect place to enjoy a beer in the evening and chat about the surf day or life.&nbsp;



**Sustainable touche.**

Today the power run with solar panel and PLN.&nbsp;

They also have an organic garden where they grow some veggies and fruits for the kitchen.

They created jobs for the community, the women is the kitchen will make you delicious food, mostly vegetarian.&nbsp;

#### Surf breaks:

Marosi is 15min walk from the camp or 5 min boat ride.&nbsp;

About a dozen different breaks, equally rights and lefts,&nbsp; are reachable within 15 minutes boat ride. Further surf break exploration to TARIMBANG aka MILLER’S RIGHT, PERO left, WAINYAPU and other secrets, can be made by Speed Boat.

#### Best season:&nbsp;

The waves are good all year around but the best time are:

* From March to June
* September to December

#### **What level can surf in Sumba?**

Surf in SUMBA is suitable for all levels, there are waves for beginners and expert surfers.

I went right after a storm so the waves were way too big for me, like barrels big hahaha.

#### How to get there?

The closest airport is TAMBOLAKA. From Denpasar ( Bali) to Tambalaka it's 1h flight, you can fly with Nam Air and take your boards.&nbsp;

Tha camp is 1,5h drive from the airport. You need to pay for transportation 700.000k.&nbsp;
